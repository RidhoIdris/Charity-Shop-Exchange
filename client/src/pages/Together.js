                The Charity Shop Exchange service enables charities to continue
                to raise funds by delivering their shopâ€™s products to a wide
                audience who value them.

                People are needing new things to read and watch, especially
                whilst stuck in their own homes, and the Charity Shop Exchange
                subscription service facilitates this in an economical way.

                For charity shops, the concept is designed to help them sell
                their books & DVDs to a wider audience. But charity shops are
                closed and face a much tougher path back to normality than most
                retail businesses. Even when some lockdown restrictions are
                eased, charity shops rely heavily upon volunteers, many who are
                in the vulnerable category themselves or may live with someone
                who is; so it could be much longer before staffed shops are
                viable.
